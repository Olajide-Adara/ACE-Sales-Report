2. Channel Optimization: Develop distinct strategies for online and in-store channels. For online, focus on converting high-volume traffic into higher average order values. For in-store, explore ways to enhance the customer experience to further capitalize on larger transactions.

3. Product Portfolio Review: Conduct a deeper dive into underperforming products to determine if they should be revitalised with new marketing, bundled offers, or considered for discontinuation to optimise product portfolio efficiency.
